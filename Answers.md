Questions

1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
   Ans. - The relationship between "Product_Category" and "Product" is a one-to-many relationship, where one product category can have multiple products associated with it, but             each product belongs to only one category.
2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
   Ans. - Use referential integrity through the use of foreign key constraints. Foreign key constraints ensure that the value in a column (or columns) of one table              matches the value in a column (or columns) of another table.
